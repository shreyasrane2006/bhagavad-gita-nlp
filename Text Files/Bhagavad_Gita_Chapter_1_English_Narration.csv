Chapter,Verse,Description
1,1,"Parth, it begins with King Dhritarashtra asking his minister Sanjay — 'What are my sons and the sons of Pandu doing in the holy land of Kurukshetra, ready for battle?' The king fears the outcome, for deep within, he knows righteousness is not on his side."
1,2,"Sanjay responds: Duryodhana, seeing the Pandava army organized and ready, approaches his teacher Dronacharya with concern and speaks."
1,3,"Duryodhana says — 'Master, observe the mighty army of the sons of Pandu, so expertly arrayed by your talented disciple, Drishtadyumna, the son of Drupad, your enemy.' Even as he addresses his teacher, his tone is laced with unease."
1,4,"He begins listing the heroic warriors among the Pandavas — Bhima, Arjuna, Yuyudhana, Virata, Drupada — all powerful and experienced."
1,5,"Duryodhana continues listing the valiant fighters — Dhrishtaketu, Chekitana, the king of Kashi, Purujit, Kuntibhoja, and Shaibya — each one a mighty warrior."
1,6,"He mentions Yudhamanyu, Uttamauja, Abhimanyu, and the sons of Draupadi — all skilled in warfare."
1,7,"Then he turns to his own army, praising warriors like Bhishma, Karna, Kripa, Ashwatthama — strong and capable."
1,8,"He continues naming others: Vikarna, the son of Somadatta — all exceptional fighters."
1,9,"Even in his praise of his army, Duryodhana reveals anxiety — fearing the Pandavas' strength."
1,10,"He admits — 'Our army, commanded by Bhishma, is strong. But theirs, led by Bhima, is also powerful.'"
1,11,"He instructs his soldiers — 'All of you stationed in various formations, protect Bhishma above all else!'"
1,12,"Then Bhishma, roaring like a lion, blew his conch to boost the morale of the Kauravas."
1,13,"Following him, conches, drums, cymbals, and horns resounded from the Kaurava side."
1,14,"Then we blew our divine conches — mine, Panchajanya; yours, Devadatta; Bhima's Paundra."
1,15,"The conches of Yudhishthira, Nakula, Sahadeva, and others followed, echoing across the battlefield."
1,16,"The conches of King Drupada, Shikhandi, Dhrishtadyumna, Virata, Satyaki, and others joined."
1,17,"The mighty King of Kashi, Shikhandi the great archer, Dhrishtaketu, Chekitana, and others joined the sound."
1,18,"The sons of Draupadi and Abhimanyu, the son of Subhadra, blew their conches too."
1,19,"The sound was thunderous, shaking both Earth and sky — a divine declaration of war."
1,20,"You, Parth, stood with your bow seeing the Kauravas ready to fight and asked me to place the chariot in the middle."
1,21,"You said — 'Krishna, let me see those gathered here to fight, those desiring to please Duryodhana.'"
1,22,'Let me see those assembled here with the intention to battle the sons of Pandu.'
1,23,'I wish to observe who I must fight against in this dharmic war.'
1,24,"I placed our chariot between both armies, in front of Bhishma, Drona, and all great warriors."
1,25,"I said, 'Behold, Parth, the warriors of the Kaurava clan assembled here.'"
1,26,"You saw uncles, grandfathers, teachers, cousins, sons, grandsons, friends — your own family."
1,27,"Seeing them, your heart filled with compassion and sorrow."
1,28,"You said — 'Krishna, seeing my kinsmen standing ready to fight, my limbs weaken, my mouth dries.'"
1,29,"'My body trembles, hair stands on end, and my bow slips from my hand.'"
1,30,"'I cannot stand, Krishna. My mind reels and I see bad omens.'"
1,31,'I see no good in killing my kinsmen in battle.'
1,32,"'What is kingdom or pleasure worth without them, Krishna?'"
1,33,'They are the very people for whose sake we seek victory — what joy will remain after their death?'
1,34,"'Teachers, fathers, sons, grandfathers, uncles, brothers, and friends — how can I harm them?'"
1,35,"'Not even for the kingdom of the three worlds would I harm them, what of just this Earth?'"
1,36,"'By killing them, we incur sin. Why should we not understand this, Krishna?'"
1,37,'Family traditions are destroyed when the family is slain in war.'
1,38,"'With traditions lost, unrighteousness dominates the women, and chaos spreads.'"
1,39,"'When women are corrupted, the caste system breaks down, and hell becomes the destiny of all.'"
1,40,"'Rituals stop, ancestors fall — all because of the destruction caused by war.'"
1,41,"'It is the ruin of the family that causes eternal suffering, Krishna.'"
1,42,"'And we, blinded by greed, are prepared to commit this crime!'"
1,43,'Better for me to be killed unarmed than to kill my elders and gurus.'
1,44,'Let them strike me down — I will not raise weapons against them.'
1,45,"And with that, Parth, you threw down your bow and arrows."
1,46,"Overwhelmed by grief, you sat down on the chariot seat, your heart clouded by sorrow."
