Chapter,Verse,Description
2,1,"Sanjay said — Seeing Arjuna overwhelmed with compassion and sorrow, Krishna, with a gentle smile, began to speak."
2,2,"I said — 'Parth, from where has this weakness come at this critical moment? This is not the behavior of an honorable man, nor does it lead to heaven. It brings disgrace.'"
2,3,"'O son of Kunti, give up this petty weakness of heart. Stand up, O scorcher of enemies!'"
2,4,"Arjuna said — 'O Madhusudana, how can I fight Bhishma and Drona with arrows in battle, they who are worthy of my worship?'"
2,5,"'It is better to live by begging than to kill these great souls who are my teachers. If I kill them, all my enjoyments will be tainted with blood.'"
2,6,"'We do not know which is better — to conquer them or be conquered by them. If we kill them, we would not wish to live, yet they stand before us.'"
2,7,"'I am confused about my duty and have lost all composure. I ask you to tell me clearly what is best. I am your disciple; guide me, Krishna.'"
2,8,"'Even if I gain an unrivaled kingdom or sovereignty over the gods, it will not drive away this grief that dries up my senses.'"
2,9,"Sanjay said — Having spoken thus, Arjuna cast aside his bow and sat down, overwhelmed with sorrow."
2,10,"O King, at that time Krishna, smiling in the midst of the two armies, began to instruct the grieving Arjuna."
2,11,"I said — 'You grieve for those who need not be grieved for, yet you speak words of wisdom. The wise do not grieve for the living or the dead.'"
2,12,"'There was never a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor all these kings — and never will there be a time when we shall cease to exist.'"
2,13,"'Just as the soul passes through childhood, youth, and old age in this body, so also it passes into another body after death. The wise are not deluded by this.'"
2,14,"'O son of Kunti, the sensations of heat and cold, pleasure and pain, are temporary. Endure them with courage, O Bharata.'"
2,15,"'The person who remains unaffected by pain and pleasure, who is steady and wise, is fit for immortality.'"
2,16,"'That which is unreal has no existence, and that which is real can never cease to be. This truth has been realized by the seers.'"
2,17,'Know that which pervades all is indestructible. No one can destroy this imperishable soul.'
2,18,"'The body is perishable, but the soul is eternal, indestructible, and immeasurable. Therefore, fight, O Bharata.'"
2,19,"'He who thinks the soul kills, and he who thinks it is killed, are both ignorant. The soul neither kills nor is killed.'"
2,20,"'The soul is never born and never dies. It is unborn, eternal, and ever-existing. It is not slain when the body is slain.'"
